    "First things first: Unlike programming languages such as Java or C, there is no dedicated main function in Python. The contents of the main function are written and executed in the global space of the file. Working with Python professionally, this not desired and is circumvented. But for this introduction, this does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creation of a function\n",
    "To define a function, the keyword <code>def</code> i used.\n",
    "Afterwards, the function receives a name and the parameters are defined with round brackets.\n",
    "The function signature is then terminated with a colon. After the colon, the code block with the contents of the function, is indented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def i_print_in_reverse(input_string):\n",
    "    result = \"\"\n",
    "    for i in range(1, len(input_string)+1):\n",
    "        result += input_string[-i] # The \"+\" operator denotes concatenation for strings\n",
    "    print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "i_print_in_reverse(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "# !dlroW olleH\n",
    "```\n",
    "More generally:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...):\n",
    "\t<Function body>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It also possible to define default values for parameters. For this, parameters are assigned values in the function signature. As soon as one default value is assigned, all parameters to the right also require default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def sum_of_up_to_four_numbers(a, b, c=0, d=0):\n",
    "    return a + b + c + d\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sum_of_up_to_four_numbers(1,2))\n",
    "# --> 3\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sum_of_up_to_four_numbers(1,2,3))\n",
    "# --> 6\n",
    "\n",
    "print(sum_of_up_to_four_numbers(1,2,3,4))\n",
    "# --> 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Return values\n",
    "The keyword <code>return</code> is used to specify what should be returned from a function. A unique property of Python is, that a function may have multiple return values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming one wants to create a function, which takes a lowercase word as an argument and should output how many vowels and consonants are present in the string. Additionally the function should output whether there are less vowels than consonants as a boolean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other programming languages would have to define a data structure for this return value, so that two integers and one boolean can be returned. In Python one can just specify those three values, separated by commas, as the return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def vowels_and_consonants(input_string):\n",
    "\tvowels_count = 0\n",
    "\tconsonants_count = 0\n",
    "\tfor letter in input_string: \t# Man kann über einen String genauso iterieren wie über eine Liste\n",
    "\t\tif letter in [\"a\", \"e\", \"i\", \"o\", \"u\"]:\n",
    "\t\t\tvowels_count += 1\n",
    "\t\telse:\n",
    "\t\t\tconsonants_count += 1\n",
    "\treturn vowels_count, consonants_count, vowels_count < consonants_count\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "vowels_count, consonants_count, there_are_more_consonants = vowels_and_consonants(\"algorithm\")\n",
    "print(vowels_count)\n",
    "# --> 3\n",
    "print(consonants_count)\n",
    "# --> 6\n",
    "print(there_are_more_consonants)\n",
    "# --> True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One can look back to Python's way of handling multiple assignments in one statement.\n",
    "Since the function returns three values and three variables are present on the left side of the assignment, this is a valid assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursion\n",
    "Recursion works in Python just like in any other programming language. A function is recursive if it calls itself. For example a recursive calculation of the n-th fibonacci number:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def fib_rek(n):\n",
    "    if n <= 1:\n",
    "        return n\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return fib_rek(n-1) + fib_rek(n-2)\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "print(fib_rek(6))\n",
    "# --> 8\n",

    "An impractical recursive solution. <code>0</code> ist known as an even number and <code>1</code> is known as an odd number. If the current value is not equal to one of those two, the function calls itself recursively with the value subtracted by <code>2</code>, until the result is either <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>. The subtraction by <code>2</code> makes the value still be either also even or also odd as the number before.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def is_even_rek(value):\n",

    "Idea: Whether an integer is even or odd depends on the last digit. Therefore it is possible to convert the number into a string and inspect the last digit. If the last digit is <code>0</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>6</code> or <code>8</code>, then it is even. Otherwise it is odd.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "def is_even_last_digit(value):\n",
    "    return int(str(value)[-1]) in [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    "```\n",

    "In Python it is also possible to work with individual bits. The <code>&</code> operator represents a bitwise and. Since the bit sequence <code>...00001</code> is equivalent to <code>1</code>, the length of the left value is irrelevant. Everything apart from the last bit will turn to <code>0</code>, therefore only the last bit can be different from zero. For an even number, the last bit is always <code>0</code>, therefore the result would be <code>0 & 1 = 0</code>. For an odd number, the last bit is always <code>1</code>, therefore the result would be <code>1 & 1 = 1</code>. <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> can then be casted to booleans. <code>0</code> will become <code>False</code> and <code>1</code> will become <code>True</code>. Since the return value would be the opposite currently, the return value can just be negated with the <code>not</code> keyword.\n",

    "    return not bool(value & 1)\n",
