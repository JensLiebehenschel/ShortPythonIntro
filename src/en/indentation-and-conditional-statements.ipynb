    "One unique trait, which sets Python apart, are the curly braces, or more fittingly, the **lack thereof**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programming languages use curly braces to define code blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1:\n",
    "```C\n",
    "if (Condition) {\n",
    "\t/* This code block is only executed in case condition holds */\n",
    "}\n",
    "/* This code will be executed regardless */\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "but it is also possible to reformat the code accordingly:\n",
    "```C\n",
    "if (Condition) {\n",
    "/* This code block is only executed in case condition holds */\n",
    "}\n",
    "/* This code will be executed regardless */\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "Option 3:\n",
    "```C\n",
    "if (Condition) {/* This code block is only executed in case condition holds*/}\n",
    "/*This code will be executed regardless*/\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Question:\\\n",
    "Which of those three options is the most readable?\\\n",
    "Answer:\\\n",
    "Option 1 is the most readable, since the code blocks the condition and those independent of the condition are separated more visually, without having to pay attention to the curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"https://cs50.readthedocs.io/style/c/#indentation\" target=\"_blank\">C Style Guides</a> also agree with me, that indentation is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is almost as if the braces can be omitted if proper indentation is present.\n",
    "Python: Yes. Curly braces in Python are not used to define code blocks. Instead, they are only used for dictionaries and sets. Dictionaries and sets will be discussed later in this introduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does Python differentiate code blocks exactly?\n",
    "By indentation (spaces or tabs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1 in a Python-like syntax would look something like this:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if (Condition)\n",
    "\t<This code block is only executed in case condition holds>\n",
    "<This code will be executed regardless>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To differentiate the condition from the code block of the condition, an intuitive solution would be a colon. That is a relatively natural way to indicate a condition.\n",
    "```\n",
    "if (this is true): # then do\n",
    "\t<that>\n",
    "<Proceed here afterwards, no matter if \"that\" has been done or not>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost like a sticky note.\n",
    "```\n",
    "if this is true:\n",
    "\tdo that\n",
    "\tand this\n",
    "\tand that\n",
    "```\n",
    "In contrast to other programming languages, round brackets are also optional for if statements.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "if (x is true):\n",
    "\t<do something>\n",
    "\n",
    "if x is true:\n",
    "\t<do something>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Round brackets are only needed if a condition spans across multiple lines.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Correct:\n",
    "if (x is true\n",
    "\tand y is true):\n",
    "\t\t<do something>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Incorrect:\n",
    "if x is true\n",
    "\tand y is true:\n",
    "\t\t<do something>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have already discussed how if statements work in Python.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if CONDITION:\n",
    "\t<CODE BLOCK OF CONDITION>\n",
    "<REST OF PROGRAM>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One must be consistent with correct indentation. Every space and every tab counts. Every part of the same code black must have the same amount of indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# Incorrect:\n",
    "if x is true:\n",
    "\tdo this\n",
    "\t  and this\n",
    "\tand that\n",

    "if x is true:\n",
    "\tdo this\n",

    "\tand that\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the code block to be executed in case the condition is not fulfilled, the keyword <code>else</code> is used. If one wants to create an <code>else-if</code>, then one can use the Python keyword <code>elif</code>.\n",
    "This works like this:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "if x == 1:\n",
    "\tprint(\"x is 1\")\n",
    "elif x == 2:\n",
    "\tprint(\"x is 2\")\n",
