# Goal
(Click [here](https://jensliebehenschel.github.io/ShortPythonIntro/de/index.html) for the german version of this page)

Initially developed for the course "algorithms and data structures" at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences,
this resource aims to introduce the basics of the Python programming language or serve as a refresher of knowledge.
Python code is often used as a replacement for pseudocode, since Python combined the readability of psuedocode with the ability of actually being executed like a real programming language.
Python is also the programming language, which serves as the basis for our e-assessment system. For those interested, more information can be found [here](https://jensliebehenschel.github.io/ADLT/).

This short introduction to Python covers most concepts, which are required to understand the most relevant algorithms and data structures. After completion of this introduction, you will be able to understand the Python code behind the most relevant algorithms and data structures.

The are many reasons for picking up Python. Those, you may read on the next page.

Here is a table contents, with which you can jump to a specific chapter directly.

Thank you very much to Edward Sp√§th, who created this beautiful Python introduction in a very short timespan. Furthermore, I would like to thank all students, who contributed to the improvement of this introduction by providing feedback.
