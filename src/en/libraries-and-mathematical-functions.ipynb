    "## Importing a library\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has an enormous selection of libraries. Be it libraries to create graphical content or libraries for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of algorithms and data structures, mathematical libraries are of particular interest. With these libraries one can use functions to calculate square roots, logarithms and much more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to use those helpful functions, one first has to import the appropriate library. From a logical perspective, it works similar to importing libraries in C. There is a keyword followed by the name of the library. Afterwards, the library can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C:\n",
    "```C\n",
    "#include <Library_name.h>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python the keyword <code>import</code> is used:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import Library_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculation of square roots and lograithms, the library <code>math</code> needs to be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, you need the following statement:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then you can use the math functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions of the math library\n",
    "\n",
    "After importing the math library, the corresponding functions can be accessed with the prefix <code>math.</code>, meaning you want to access a function of that library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of 25 could be calculated as follows using the function <code>math.sqrt()</code>:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "x = math.sqrt(25)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "# --> 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the base 10 logarithm of x, one can use the function <code>math.log10()</code>:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "x = math.log10(100)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "# --> 2\n",
