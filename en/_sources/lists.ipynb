    "## Lists in general\n",
    "A widely used data structure is the \"array\". In Python there is a data structure called \"list\". Conceptually, they are identical. It is a linear data structure, in which one can store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other programming languages use curly braces to fill arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example in C:\n",
    "```C\n",
    "int Array_name[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python used square brackets to symbolize lists.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "List_name = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above example it is never given, that the list consists of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is due to Python's dynamic typing. In Python this is not just an integer list, but one can also add other elements of any data type to the same list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \"Hello World!\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In most programming languages this would not be easily possible. This is also not due to the numbers 1 through 5 being implicitly converted to strings to have matching data types. The above list have multiple different data types. One can check this with the function <code>type()</code>, which was already discussed in the context of dynamic typing in a previous chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refresher:\n",
    "The function <code>type(object)</code> returns the data type or class of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we call this function for the different elements, by using the usual square brackets to denote access to a given index (starting at 0), then we can observe this:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \"Hello World!\"]\n",
    "print(type(my_list[0]))\n",
    "# <class 'int'>\n",
    "# --> Object at index 0 is and integer\n",
    "\n",
    "print(type(my_list[5]))\n",
    "# <class 'str'>\n",
    "# --> Object at index 5 is and string\n",
    "```\n",
    "Therefore, <code>1</code> is an integer and <code>\"Hello World!\"</code> is a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reversing lists\n",
    "If one wants to reverse a list\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "so that the list starts at <code>5</code> and ends at <code>1</code>, the function <code>reverse()</code> can be used. The function is similar to <code>sort()</code>, but instead of sorting, it just reverses the order of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(nums)\n",
    "# --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "nums.reverse()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(nums)\n",
    "# --> [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fast initialization of lists\n",
    "In case you want to initialize a list with a given amount of a single value, such as a list consisting of 10 zeroes, then you can either the list directly or call <code>append(0)</code> ten times:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "nums = []\n",
    "for i in range(0, 10):  # This loop runs 10 times\n",
    "    nums.append(0)\n",
    "    \n",
    "print(nums)\n",
    "# --> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, there is a shortcut for exactly something like this in Python with the following syntax:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "LIST_NAME = [VALUE] * AMOUNT_OCCURENCES\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So for the above example, it would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [0] * 10\n",
    "\n",
    "print(nums)\n",
    "# --> [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Negative indices\n",
    "Python has a convenient shortcut for accessing the k-last element in a list (in this case the list is called \"num\").\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is: <code>nums[-k]</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "So with a negative index.\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>nums[-1]</code> accesses the last element, <code>nums[-2]</code> accesses the one before last and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "While programming you should pay attentation, that negative indices in Python are valid and therefore do not necessarily result in an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Length of a list\n",
    "To retrieve the length of a list, the function <code>len()</code> is used, just like when identifying the length of a string.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "print(len(nums))\n",
    "# --> 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Append\n",
    "To add an element to the back of an already existing list, the <code>append()</code> method can be used.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "print(nums)\n",
    "# --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "print(len(nums))\n",
    "# --> 5\n",
    "\n",
    "nums.append(6)\n",
    "print(nums)\n",
    "# --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "print(len(nums))\n",
    "# --> 6\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One can add as many entries as one wants, since the list is a dynamic data structure, in contrast to arrays in C, where a specific maximum length has to be specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to create empty lists, which can then have values inserted using <code>append()</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "An empty list is initialized as follows:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = []\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check whether a list contaisns a given element\n",
    "For this the keyword <code>in</code> can be used.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "x = [1,2,3,4,5]\n",
    "print(3 in x)\n",
    "# --> True\n",
    "# 3 is present in x.\n",
    "\n",
    "print(42 in x)\n",
    "# --> False\n",
    "# 42 is not present in x.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concatenating lists\n",
    "To concatenate two lists, the operator <code>+</code> can be used. Just like with strings, <code>+</code> for lists also denotes concatenation:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "b = [4, 5, 6]\n",
    "\n",
    "print(a + b)\n",
    "# --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slicing\n",
    "The concept of slicing is utilized to get adjacent sublists. For this two indices are specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a subsequence depending on a condition, so called \"list comprehension\" is used. This is too advanced for this introduction and will not be discussed here. Those who are interested, may research that topic themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to slicing. An example application would be to get a sublist consisting of all the element after index <code>a</code>, including <code>a</code> itself, and before <code>b</code>, excluding <code>b</code> itself, or combination of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, the following syntax is used:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums[a:b]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The left side of the colon indicates which index should be used as the starting index and the right side indicates which index should not be included.\n",
    "If one wants to leave a side unmodified, one can omit the side.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three options for slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case A:\n",
    "Sublist up until index <code>b</code>, not including <code>b</code> itself.\n",
    "Here, <code>b</code> is provided as the first index, which should **not** be included in the sublist:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>nums[:b]</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "# index 0  1  2  3  4\n",
    "print(nums[:3])\n",
    "# --> [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example would be identical to <code>nums[0:3]</code>. Since the left side was omitted, Python knows that the sublist should start at the start of the original list.\n",
    "It would also be identical to <code>nums[:-2]</code>, since the index <code>-2</code> is used to access the second to last element, which is also the element at index <code>3</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case B:\n",
    "Sublist starting at index <code>a</code>, including <code>a</code> itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>nums[a:]</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "# index 0  1  2  3  4\n",
    "print(nums[2:])\n",
    "# --> [3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>nums[2:]</code> is the same as <code>nums[2:len(nums)]</code>, since the length of the list is the first index, whih is not present in the list naymore. If the highest index would be <code>4</code>, then capturing the whole list means up until, excluding, <code>5</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Case C:\n",
    "Sublist starting at index <code>a</code> up until (exclusive) index <code>b</code>:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>nums[a:b]</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "# index 0  1  2  3  4\n",
    "print(nums[1:3])\n",
    "# --> [2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from index <code>1</code> up until (exklusive) index <code>3</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overwrite the original list with the sublist, the assignment operator can be used.\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = nums[:-1]   # Removes the last element\n",
    "nums = nums[1:]    # Removes the first element\n",
    "nums = nums[2:-2]  # Removes the first two and last two elements\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deleting elements in a list\n",
    "To delete specific elements in a list, there are three options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the element to be deleted, is located at the start or end of the list, then it an be removed using slicing. Example for deleting the first element of a list:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums = nums[1:]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The advantage is, that you can delete multiple elements if they are at the beginning or at the end. For example, you can use <code>nums = nums[3:]</code> to delete the first three elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the keyword <code>del</code> to delete a given element. The syntax is the following:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "del nums[index_to_be_deleted]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "If one want to delete just the first element in the list, one can use the function <code>pop()</code>:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "nums.pop()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can imagine it as the opposite operation to <code>append()</code>, which instead of inserting at the back of the list, deletes at the front of the list."
