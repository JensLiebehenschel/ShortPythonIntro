# Changes planned for beginning of 2025

## The course shall be available in English as well
* Implementation in a usual / standard way
* There shall be two different links for German and English
* It shall be possible to switch the language on any page
  * If it is too difficult to stay on the page, then it is ok to got to the main page

## Additional language constructs to be added (to both languages)
These constructs shall be integrated in a useful order (with exercises, if helpful):
* Dictionaries (Hashmaps)
* Löschen von Elementen aus einer List (A, B, C)
* Tupel
* 2D Listen ("Matrizen")
* Mengen / Sets


## Remarks
* The animation of "Interaktivität dieser Einführung" shall show the result of "print" much longer
  * it is unreadable for people who do not know about the content
  * perhaps move the mouse slower over the result
* Add something like "Advanced"
  * e.g. as heading on page "Ziel" between "Funktionen" and "Klassen"
  The beforementioned additional constructs might also be advanced
* Remove the focus on AlgDat (at all places), 
  * mention that it was initially developped for AlgDat and 
  * that it is also applicable to our project (with link on website to be created)
* Cleanup [Potentiell_hinzufuegbar.md](Potentiell_hinzufuegbar.md) - adapt to current state when done
