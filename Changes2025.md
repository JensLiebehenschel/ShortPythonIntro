# Changes planned for beginning of 2025

## The course shall be available in English as well
* Implementation of internationalization in a usual / standard way
  * Based on one "text/code base" for a better maintainability, if possible
* There shall be two different links for German and English (for external usage)
* It shall be possible to switch the language on any page
  * If it is too difficult to stay on the page, then it is ok to got to the main page

## Additional language constructs to be added (to both languages)
These constructs (based on [Potentiell_hinzufuegbar.md](Potentiell_hinzufuegbar.md)) shall be integrated in a useful order (with exercises, if helpful):
* Dictionaries (Hashmaps)
* Löschen von Elementen aus einer List (all alternatives A, B, C)
* Tupel
* 2D Listen ("Matrizen")
* Mengen / Sets

## Remarks
* The animation on page "Interaktivität dieser Einführung" shall show the result of "print" much longer
  * It is unreadable for people who do not know about the content
  * Perhaps move the mouse slower over the print output
* Add something like "Advanced" at one place
  * E.g. as heading on page "Ziel" between "Funktionen" and "Klassen"
  * No change in chapters / on pages necessary
  * The beforementioned additional constructs might also be advanced
* Remove the focus on AlgDat (at all places),
  * mention that it was initially developped for AlgDat and 
  * that it is also applicable to our project (with link on website to be created)
* Cleanup [Potentiell_hinzufuegbar.md](Potentiell_hinzufuegbar.md) - adapt to current state when chnages are done

## Warranty and Info
* Add Warranty notice to Footer
* Add links to the FRA-UAS website
